# QuantumAssembly
This is a single-qubit quantum gate simulator which implements the following single-qubit quantum logic gates: Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, Phase and Ï€/8. It takes in a text file which contains a logic circuit written using the correct syntax as detailed below.

The language is very simple, a quantum logic gate circuit can be formed by a series of "Commands". Commands will consist of two components; a focus and a gate. A focus is an integer i denoting the ith qubit of the system. A gate is simply a letter representing the application of the associated quantum logic gate. The following table shows the logic gates and their associated letter.

| Letter | Gate     |
|--------|----------|
| H      | Hadamard |
| X      | Pauli-X  |
| Y      | Pauli-Y  |
| Z      | Pauli-Z  |
| P      | Phase    |
| E      | pi/8     |

The grammar of the language is as follows; there is only 1 command string per line, where command = "focus"+"gate" and the order is important. Deviating from this grammar will result in a syntax error being displayed.

```
1: 1X
2: 2Z
3: 2P
4: 3E
5: 1Y
```

Above is an example quantum logic gate circuit, with the numbers on the left denoting line numbers within the text document.

Usage instructions:
- Clone the repo to a directory of your choosing, ensuring Python 3 is installed (and specified in PATH on Windows).
- Create a text file containing your quantum logic gate circuit according to the grammar above. Make a note of the file path.
- Run "executor.py" and follow the prompts as directed. Note that the number of qubits must be equal to or greater than the largest focus in your text file.
